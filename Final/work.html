						<h2>My Work</h2>
						<p>
                            My current place of employment is Ash Brokerage. I am a help desk intern here and I have been working at this job since May 2021. In this job I answer
							phone calls to assist people with their technical needs. I have to also deal with physical things like using SCCM, diagnosing hardware issuse, 
							and setting up workspaces for new employees.
							<p>I have also had a few pevious job that had all kinds of responsibilities. I started off my very first job as a lifeguard. After this job I took a few
							restaurant jobs that all varied from eachother. One I was a hostess and busser. The next one I was also a hostess but I did not clean the tables at
							all. The last restaurant job I had was as a great server representative	or GSR. This position was just essentially a cashier. Then I ended the restaurant
							journey working in IT.
