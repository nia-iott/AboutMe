						<h1>All About Me</h1>
						<h2>Nia Iott</h2>
						<p>
							Hi, I am Nia Iott. I am 19 years old. I was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana. I have lived in Indiana my entire life.  
							One of my dreams in life is to travel and get to see the world. I have only been to four state including the one I live 
							in. I have been to Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan. The farthest north I have ever traveled was the UP of Michigan. 
							My dream is to see the ocean and be able to taste it. I know it will taste bad but I want to say that I have done it.</p>
							<p>I have a few goals in life. My first goal is to become a home owner before I turn the age of 21. I think it 
							would be amazing to own my own house so young. I also have never been on an airplane and I think it sounds amazing. I plan 
							to fly somewhere in the next year or so.
